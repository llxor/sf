                                       sf

sf provides a simple frontend for compilers and other command line tools, such
as gcc, clang and grep.

Navigation is done using j/k or <UP>/<DOWN>, <ENTER> to open an error, and q
to quit the interface.

In config.h, the editor escape sequences are; %f: file, %l: line and %c: col.

To install sf, install `ncurses` on your OS, and then run `./build.sh`. To
remove this software, delete /usr/bin/sf
